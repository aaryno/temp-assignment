## Function 1: load_and_explore_gis_data()

### AI Assistance Used
**What Copilot helped with:**
- [ ] Pandas syntax for reading CSV files
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Data exploration methods (info(), describe(), head())
- [ ] Other: ________________

**Questions I asked AI:**
1. "How do I read a CSV file with pandas and handle missing values?"
2. [Add your other questions here]

### My GIS Expertise Applied  
**Decisions I made (that AI couldn't decide for me):**
- [ ] What information is most important to display about GIS datasets
- [ ] How to interpret coordinate columns vs attribute data  
- [ ] What constitutes reasonable data ranges for environmental sensors
- [ ] How to present results for non-technical GIS users

**My analysis:** 
```
[Explain why you made specific choices about data exploration approach]
