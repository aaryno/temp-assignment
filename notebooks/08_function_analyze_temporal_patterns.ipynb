        "## ðŸŽ¯ What This Function Does\n",
        "- Converts date columns to pandas datetime objects\n",
        "- Calculates temporal trends and seasonal patterns\n",
        "- Performs time-based grouping and resampling\n",
        "- Identifies patterns across multiple time scales\n",
        "- Generates comprehensive temporal analysis reports\n",

        "## ðŸ¤– AI Learning Objectives\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
        "1. **Use Copilot CHAT** to understand pandas datetime functionality\n",
        "2. **Use AGENT mode** to implement groupby operations and time resampling\n",
        "3. **Use EDIT mode** to add trend analysis and statistical calculations\n",
        "4. **Learn about** datetime indexing, time series analysis, and temporal aggregation\n",
