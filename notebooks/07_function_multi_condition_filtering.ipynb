        "- Applies multiple filtering conditions from a configuration\n",
        "- Uses complex boolean operations and logical combinations\n",
        "- Implements dynamic filtering based on column types\n",
        "- Supports custom filter functions with lambda expressions\n",
        "- Provides detailed filtering reports and statistics\n",
