    "## 🤖 **STEP 1: GitHub Copilot Setup & AI Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🚨 IMPORTANT: Your Learning Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment uses AI to ENHANCE your learning, not replace it:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 **YOU decide the analysis approach** (what questions to ask, what data to explore)\n",
    "- 🤖 **AI helps with syntax and implementation** (how to write pandas code)\n",
    "- 📚 **YOU learn the concepts** (understanding what the code does and why)\n",
    "- 🔍 **YOU validate results** (making sure the analysis makes sense)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🎓 The Three Copilot Modes You'll Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **💬 ASK Mode** - Get Explanations\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ask questions about concepts, methods, and approaches\n",
    "- **How to use**: Open Copilot Chat panel, ask specific questions\n",
    "- **Example Questions**:\n",
    "  - \"What is the difference between pandas merge and join?\"\n",
    "  - \"How do I filter rows in pandas based on multiple conditions?\"\n",
    "  - \"What does groupby do in pandas and when would I use it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🤖 AGENT Mode** - Get Code Suggestions  \n",
    "- **Purpose**: Get code completion as you type\n",
    "- **How to use**: Type comments or start code, accept/reject suggestions with Tab/Esc\n",
    "- **Example**: Type `# load csv file with pandas` and see what Copilot suggests\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✏️ EDIT Mode** - Improve Existing Code\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Refactor, optimize, or fix existing code\n",
    "- **How to use**: Select code, right-click → \"Copilot\" → \"Start Inline Chat\" or use `Ctrl+I`\n",
    "- **Example**: Select basic code and ask \"make this more efficient\" or \"add error handling\"\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll learn essential pandas skills by implementing **8 functions** that work with real environmental monitoring data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and explore** CSV files (like opening a spreadsheet)\n",
    "2. **Filter data** based on conditions (remove bad quality readings)\n",
    "3. **Calculate statistics** by groups (summarize by weather station)\n",
    "4. **Join datasets** together (combine location info with readings)\n",
    "5. **Save processed data** (export results for QGIS or Excel)\n",
    "6. **Validate coordinate data** (check for invalid locations)\n",
    "7. **Multi-condition filtering** (complex data selection)\n",
    "8. **Analyze temporal patterns** (time-based data analysis)\n",
